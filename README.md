# turtle-crossing-game

This is a 2D game developed using Turtle Graphics. 
A famous learning tool for GUI specially curated for beginners. 
Use the simple Keyboard Arrow UP key to move the turtle toward the top of the screen. 
After each completion, the level increases, and the speed of passing cars increases.
I am planning to add more visually pretty cars.
And a background image for a beautifully paved road and more controls for the Turtle. Enjoy!

Built using Python 3.
